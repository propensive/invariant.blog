#### _a blog about programming_

**WELCOME TO MY BLOG**. Here I write about programming, primarily with
[Scala 3](https://scala-lang.org/), but more generally about advanced
statically-typed programming and related technical topics.

This is my outlet for essays on the influences, motivations and decisions which
contributed towards my software projects, [Soundness](https://soundness.dev/)
and [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury), and a place to share ideas.

This blog is new, so there is only one post so far: an introduction to a
new series on [error handling](/error-handling).
